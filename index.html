        For this portfolio I re-visited my previous assignments throughout the
        year and made appropriate changes to them. Laid out below are the new
        and improved website links, along with an outline of the changes I have
        made to each.

      </h4>
      <h3>Website Changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the footer, I put the 'i' element inside the li as they can't be
          the direct child of a ul element, I made this correction based off the
          feedback I received for this assignment. I also changed the footer li
          to bold and made them smaller.
        </li>
        <li>Changed the cursor to a pointer for the hamburger menu.</li>
        <li>
          Made the whole CTA button clickable on the home page, instead of just
          the text inside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed the href to the norwegian version of the pages when the li
          items are clicked in the header and footer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set the HTML whitespace sensitivity to ignore to remove any strange
          wrapping issues in the HTML. I made this correction based off the
          feedback I received for this assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed the styling on the store page and product specific page to
          neaten it up (add to basket buttons, the h1s, the h2s, spacing around
          items).
        </li>
        <li>
          Added functionality to the add to basket buttons so items get added to
          a basket and the total price of the items gets added up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Removed the basket icon from the heading as it has no functionality so
          looks confusing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added a checkout button that takes you to a basket items page using
          local storage.
        </li>
        <li>Added a payment page that uses form validation.</li>
      </ul>

      </h4>
      <h3>Website Changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the nav li to change colour on hover.</li>
        <li>Gave the main a max width of 1000px to make it easier to read.</li>
        <li>
          Removed the second, smaller images on the exhibition info as they
          looked out of place.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increased the margins on the hr tags to give more space to the
          sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed the width and height of the images on the exhibitions page
          (some were different sizes to others).
        </li>
        <li>Changed the favicon to the atom logo image.</li>
        <li>
          Centred the social media icons and added more space around them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Neatened up the CSS, grouped together global stylings and media
          queries. This was based off feedback I had received.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grouped together font families in one style sheet and added
          Montserrat. This was based off feedback I had received.
        </li>
      </ul>
